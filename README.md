# Image-Teachable-Model
A Sign Language Image Detection model implemented in Python using TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Overview

This project aims to build a computer vision model to recognize sign language gestures from images. The model is developed using TensorFlow for deep learning and OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- **Sign Language Detection:** Recognize sign language gestures from input images.
- **TensorFlow Model:** Utilizes the TensorFlow library for training and deploying the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV Integration:** Uses OpenCV for image processing and capturing frames from input sources.
